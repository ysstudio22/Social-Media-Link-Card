### Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

I'd like to share a few things from this challenge that were meaningful to me.

---
## What I learned

The biggest feature about this challenge was styling the social media link buttons in the card.  The buttons and text had to change color when the cursor was above the button.

## My Process
1. I checked the designs to see the requirements are.
2. I added all the HTML elements including the links to the Google font and style sheet.
3. I started styling the bigger components first and gradually made my way to smaller components.  I went back and forth between the design and my output for accuracy.
